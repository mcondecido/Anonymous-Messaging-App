# Anonymous-Messaging-App

Might need to do the following to run the code locally (all under the Anonymous-Messaging-App folder):

- pip install crispy_forms

- pip install crispy_bootstrap5",

- pip install django_celery_beat

- pip install floppyforms

- python3 manage.py makemigrations

- python3 manage.py migrate

- python3 manage.py runserver

From Project Report: 
"Since our app is running locally, to test the functionality of multiple people in the same room, go to the local url in your browser and in an incognito tab. If you are in the same room, youâ€™ll receive messages from both 'users'."
